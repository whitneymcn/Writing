The benefits of revision control for writing are obvious, and many people (including myself) have 
gone beyond a folder full of files with dates or version numbers attached to them, but can you 
write something that's native to the system?

You have the content, but also the commit messages. You have branching. You have pull requests.
Can something interesting be done here?

What's best for the first change? Which route leads to the most interesting work?
