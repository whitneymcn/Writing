The benefits of revision control for writing are obvious, and many people (including myself) have 
gone beyond a folder full of files with dates or version numbers attached to them, but can you 
write something that's native to the system?

You have the content, but also the commit messages. You have branching. You have pull requests.
Can something interesting be done here?

The first update is a small one. A minor change, but recorded.
Had I been more clever about it the original file contents would have made it more 
difficult to track what is new and what is not -- a very difficult piece for 
string bass as model -- but it didn't. Alas.
